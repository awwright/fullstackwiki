			<h1>410 Gone</h1>
			<p>The 410 (Gone) HTTP status code indicates the requested resource previously existed on the server, but no longer does.</p>
			<p>This status code is considered a 4xx client error because it is not a server error; the resource was deliberately removed and it is expected to be gone indefinitely.</p>

			<h2>Writing responses (servers)</h2>
			<p>This status code is a more specific variation of <a href="404.xml">404 Not Found</a> which implies the resource previously existed.</p>
			<p>If the resource was merely moved, servers should use <a href="308.xml">308 Permanent Redirect</a> instead.</p>

			<h2>Reading responses (clients)</h2>
			<p>This is the expected error code after a resource has been deleted by a client.</p>
			<p>See <a href="404.xml">404 Not Found</a> for additional handling.</p>

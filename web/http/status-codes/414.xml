			<h1>414 URI Too Long</h1>
			<p>The 414 URI Too Long HTTP status code indicates an unexpected or over-long request message body. In some environments, a lengthy request URI may trigger <a href="431.xml">431 Request Header Fields Too Large</a>, especially in HTTP/2, where the request-URI follws the same syntax as a header (see <i>Implementations</i> below).</p>

			<h2>Writing responses (servers)</h2>
			<p>On the Web and in HTTP, URIs are allowed to be indefinitely long; there is no defined limitation on URI length. However, at some point, long URIs can become technically infeasable, causing performance issues, excessive resource consumption, and can even be a vector for attacks against cryptographic systems if compressed over the wire. There are two triggers for this status code:</p>

			<h3>Parsing terminated</h3>
			<p>If the request-line is being parsed and the client has sent more characters than the server-defined maximum, terminate parsing, return <code>414 URI Too Long</code> with <code>Connection: close</code>, and close the stream.</p>

			<h3>Request fully parsed</h3>
			<p>If the server fully parsed the request headers, the server may still indicate one of the headers is too long to be used in processing the request.</p>


			<h2>Reading responses (clients)</h2>
			<p>The resource the client is trying to request probably does not exist, it does not make sense to re-try this request, but a request for a different resource could be considered instead.</p>

			<h2>Implementations</h2>
			<h3>Node.js</h3>
			<p>Node.js has a builtin HTTP parser that will respond if a header line exceeds the maximum allowed length. It treats the request-line the same as a header-line, see <a href="431.xml">431 Request Header Too Long</a> for setting this limit and generating a custom response when handling this error.</p>

			<!-- TODO: If there are any clients that can re-make a request with the correct Content-Type or Content-Encoding, list them here -->

			<h1>401 Unauthorized</h1>
			<p>The 401 (Unauthorized) HTTP status code indicates the user lacks permission or credentials to perform the request.</p>
			<p>It varies from <a href="403.xml">403 (Forbidden)</a> in that 401 implies an authorization problem that can be fixed with the correct credentials. <code>403</code>, by contrast, is not related to authorization, does not respond with a <a href="../headers/WWW-Authenticate.xml">WWW-Authenticate</a> header, and implies the request is understood, but not possible.</p>

			<h2>Writing responses (servers)</h2>
			<p>Use <code>401 (Unauthorized)</code> when the request requires permission, and the user has not provided credentials for the operation, or has provided credentials with insufficient access.</p>
			<p>Authorization is tested once the resource, and method handler on the resource, is known to exist; so this status code is tested after <a href="404.xml">404 (Not Found)</a>, <a href="410.xml">410 (Gone)</a>, <a href="403.xml">403 (Forbidden)</a>, and <a href="405.xml">405 (Method Not Allowed)</a>. If this reveals too much information about the resource, consider using <a href="404.xml">404 (Not Found)</a> instead.</p>
			<p>If permitted by the <a href="../headers/Allow.xml">Allow request-header</a>, return a short response body that describes that access is denied, and how to authenticate a subsequent request.</p>

			<h2>Reading responses (clients)</h2>
			<p>401 errors can be retried with different credentials. Read the <a href="../headers/WWW-Authenticate.xml">WWW-Authenticate response header</a> to determine which credentials are necessary, and show a prompt that allows the user to provide the credentials necessary. If the user did not provide any credentials, show the response body as an error message.</p>

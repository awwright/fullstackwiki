			<h1>507 Insufficient Storage</h1>
			<p>The 507 Insufficient Storage HTTP status code indicates the server does not have enough free storage to perform the operation. The client can re-try the operation at some time in the future when more storage becomes available.</p>
			<p>This status code is defined by WebDAV, but available for use in any applicaion.</p>

			<h2>Writing responses (servers)</h2>
			<p>Servers should produce <code>507 Insufficient Storage</code> when the operation requires free disk space, but not enough is available to complete the operation. <code>500 Internal Server Error</code> can also be used for this error, but it is less specific.</p>
			<p>Servers should link to a system status page that provides any progress updates from the system administrator, and customer service contact information.</p>

			<h3>See also: Message body exceeds resource limits</h3>
			<p>If the server technically has the space to accept an upload, but would prefer not to because it exceeds a specified resource limit, this is considered a user error and not a server error, see <a href="413.xml">413 Payload Too Large</a> instead.</p>

			<h2>Reading responses (clients)</h2>
			<p>Typically this requires user intervention, either the attention of the system administrator, or the user confirming out-of-band that the system is back into regular operation, before retrying the request.</p>
			<p>If the server specifies <a href="../headers/Retry-After.xml">Retry-After</a>, this might signal that additional storage is being automatically provisioned, and clients may automatically retry an upload after the given duration. Clients should send <code>Expect: 100-continue</code> when making uploads, to not waste bandwidth on a request that will likely be rejected.</p>

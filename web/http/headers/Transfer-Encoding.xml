			<h1>Transfer-Encoding</h1>
			<p>The Transfer-Encoding header field lists the mechanisms used by the connection to transmit the message body (including the content coding already applied to it). The primary use is to signal a <i>chunked</i> transmission of the message body when the length is not known in advance.</p>
			<p>Transfer-Encoding is a property of an HTTP/1.1 connection (it is not used in HTTP/1.0 and not relevant to HTTP/2).</p>
			<p>It is mutually exclusive with the <a href="Content-Length.xml">Content-Length</a> header. See <a href="https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7230.html#message.body.length">RFC 7230 &#xA7;3.3.3. Message Body Length</a> for how to determine the message body length.</p>
			<p>Messages can be encoded with any number of transfer codings, but if any, messages must use <code>chunked</code> as the outermost one, so that the end of the transfer can reliably be identified. Implementations will typically use "chunked" by itself, and any compression is applied as a content coding using the <a href="Content-Encoding.xml">Content-Encoding header</a>.</p>

			<h2 id="request-write-client">Writing requests (clients)</h2>
			<p>Transfer-Encoding is typically sent in HTTP/1.1 requests when the length of the upload is unknown. Servers may require the client send a Content-Length header instead, and will return <code>411 Length Required</code> error in this case.</p>

			<h2 id="request-read-server">Reading requests (servers)</h2>
			<p>This header is only meaningful in HTTP/1.1 connections, return <code>400 Client Error</code> and close the connection if used in another HTTP version.</p>
			<p>Parse the headers outermost to innermost. If any tokens are not understood, return <code> 501 (Not Implemented)</code> with a short description.</p>
			<p>The outermost transfer coding can define when an EOF is present</p>

			<h2 id="response-write-server">Writing responses (servers)</h2>
			<p>Transfer-Encoding is frequently used for responses where the full length of the message is not known in advance of writing the response body.</p>
			<p>A server MUST NOT send a Transfer-Encoding header field in any response with a status code of 1xx (Informational) or 204 (No Content), or in response to a CONNECT request; as these responses do not have a body.</p>

			<h2 id="response-read-client">Reading responses (clients)</h2>
			<p>It is difficult to recover from a response with an unknown Transfer-Encoding header. See <a href="https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7230.html#message.body.length">RFC 7230 &#xA7;3.3.3. Message Body Length</a> for advice on how to read responses with a Transfer-Encoding header.</p>

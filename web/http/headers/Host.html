			<h1>Host</h1>

			<h2>Preface</h2>
			<p>In the olden days, the Web was a much simpler place. An HTTP server was assumed to serve a single set of documents, and that's as a good of a job that it could be expected to do. This posed some some growth problems because it effectively required that different domain names to be hosted on by HTTP servers. This was later more formally supported by recent developments in networking architecture & design specifying that a URL is a subset of a class of URIs, that can name things in general, without necessarially pointing to a network location, and that servers should be able to respond to requests for <em>any</em> resource under an authority routed to them.</p>
			<p>And so the Host header was introduced to HTTP, which more or less provides enough information to reconstruct the full Request-URI that the client is looking for. It is a required request header.</p>

			<h2>Making Requests</h2>
			<p>The Host header is required, even if it would be redundant or the receiving end is known to not support the header. The value must be a valid hostname and optional port, and match the hostname part of the authority of the Request-URI; or left blank if the URI has no authority component (the part after the leading "//").</p>
			<p>And so the Host header was introduced to HTTP, which more or less provides enough information to reconstruct the full Request-URI that the client is looking for. It is a required request header.</p>
			<p>Since the value is used to construct the Request-URI and is used for routing, it should be placed as the first header (closest to the Request-Line of the HTTP request), for example:</p>

			<pre type="message/http" w:space="indent">
				GET /pub/WWW/ HTTP/1.1
				Host: www.example.org
			</pre>

			<h2>Parsing Requests</h2>
			<p>If a request lacks or has more than one Host header, it MUST generate a <code>400 Bad Request</code> response.</p>

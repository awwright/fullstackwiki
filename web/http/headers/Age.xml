			<h1>Age</h1>
			<p>The Age header indicates the response was served from a cache without verification from the origin server; the value provides the number of seconds since the resource was updated with the origin server.</p>

			<h2>Reading responses</h2>
			<p>The value of the <code>Age</code> header is a non-negative integer. Implementations may wish to verify the value doesn't overflow the size of the number it's being read into during parsing.</p>
			<p><code>Age</code> was introduced in HTTP/1.1, and might not be implemented by old HTTP caches, or caches that refuse to honor the Age header.</p>
			<!-- TODO: Why would this header be important to clients? -->

			<h2>Writing responses</h2>
			<p>For the conditions when a cache may serve a cached response, see Caching.</p>

			<!-- Nits: this seems inconsistent with other HTTP headers that specify an absolute date, instead of a relative time -->

			<pre type="message/http">Age: 3550</pre>
			<p>Here, the resource was returned from a cache, and the entry was populated just under an hour ago (just under 3600 seconds).</p>

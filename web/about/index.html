			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Fullstack.wiki is a repository of documentation for how to build reliable, accessible, cross-platform Web applications.</p>

			<h2>Accessibility</h2>
			<p>The goal of Fullstack.wiki is to document how to build applications and websites "maximally accessible" to 97% of the population.</p>
			<p>By <i>maximally accessible</i>, we mean each aspect of the application (e.g. visibility, customizability, load time, or any aspect that might prevent a user from using a feature of the application) is not significantly less accessible than a top quintile website for that aspect.</p>
			<p>We think 97% is a realistic goal that is achievable without significant additional cost to developers if they're given good tooling and documentation.</p>

			<h2>Authoring</h2>
			<p>Content is authored in bare HTML files annotated with RDFa. Data about the content is embedded using RDFa, extracted from the documents, and used to create lists of content elsewhere.</p>

			<h2>Pertinence</h2>
			<p>Having up-to-date answers to problems is important. Most writing should include when the information was last reviewed for correctness. All information should be reviewed and updated from time-to-time.</p>

			<h2>Nits</h2>
			<p>Often while looking in retrospect, we wouldn't have designed standards the way they were. We should learn from these mistakes and point out the right way to do it, so they don't get repeated. These should be pointed out as soon as they're introduced, if possible. Articles should have a section called "Nits" that describes the problems, and the right way to go about them.</p>
			<p>These problems might include things such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Misspellings</li>
				<li>Inconstistencies between standards</li>
				<li>Willful violations of standards</li>
				<li>Historical reasons for bad behavior</li>
			</ul>

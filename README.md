## Charter

Fullstack.wiki is a repository of documentation for how to build reliable, accessible, cross-platform Web applications.

This repository includes all the broad categories of content:

* Original specification text, for offline reference
* Writing technical standards & participating in standards groups
* Writing Web applications
* Writing Web user-agents
* Techniques & tools for programming


## Principles

* Document techniques for building reliable, accessible, cross-platform Web applications.
* Centrally document how to implement tbe standards, cross referencing the relevant documents.
* Keep things simple.
* Only document best practices, not everything you can possibly do.
* Document implementation status by each platform.
* Inform users how to degrade on platforms that don't support the feature.
* Emphasize security and defense in depth.
* Keep accessibility, UX, and security notes in-line as essential requirements, not as separate sections.


## Building

Install Node.js

Install NPM packages
run `make`


## Technical features for building the documentation

* Convert plaintext RFCs to HTML
* Host other specifications as HTML
* Extract RDF data from HTML pages
* Build indexes from RDF data
* Provide a page describing each feature
* Provide examples on how to use each feature
* Provide implementation status of features by different implementations

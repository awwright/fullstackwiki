# WebDev.docs

## Charter

WebDev.docs is a repository of documentation for how to build reliable, accessible, cross-platform Web applications.

This repository includes all the broad categories of content:

* Original specification text, for offline reference
* Writing technical standards & participating in standards groups
* Writing Web applications
* Writing Web user-agents
* Techniques & tools for programming


## Principles

* Don't document things just because they exist.
* Keep things simple.
* Document implementation status by each platform.
* Inform users how to degrade on platforms that don't support the feature.
* Document techniques for building reliable, accessible, cross-platform Web applications.
* Emphasize security and practices that fail safely when only partially implemented.
* Centrally document how to implement standards.
* Keep accessibility, UX, and security notes in-line as essential requirements, not as separate sections.

			<h1>Expect</h1>
			<p>The "Expect" header field in a request indicates a certain set of behaviors (expectations) that need to be supported by the server in order to properly handle this request.</p>
			<p>The only feature that uses this header is <a href="../server.xml#handle-100-continue">100-continue</a>.</p>

			<h3>Writing requests (clients)</h3>
			<p>The Expect header is designed to indicate to the server that the client expects a specific behavior in order to function properly.</p>
			<p>In the case of <code>100-continue</code>, the client is signaling that it won't begin uploading the request-body until the server signals it is acceptable to do so. Servers that do not support this would send 417, and the client can retry the request without 100-continue.</p>

			<h3>Reading requests (servers)</h3>
			<p>If the header exists, and is a value not <code>100-continue</code>, return <a href="../status-codes/417.xml">417 Expectation Failed</a>.</p>

			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<pre type="abnf" w:space="indent">
				Expect = "100-continue"
			</pre>

			<h3>Example with 100 Continue</h3>
			<p>The client begins by writing just the headers of the request:</p>
			<pre type="message/http" w:space="indent">
				PUT / HTTP/1.1
				Host: localhost
				Content-Type: text/plain
				Content-Length: 10
				Expect: 100-continue
			</pre>
			<p>The server verifies it can accept an upload of <code>text/plain</code> of 10 bytes by sending an intermediate status:</p>
			<pre type="message/http" w:space="indent">
				HTTP/1.1 100 Continue
			</pre>
			<p>The client finishes writing out the body part of the message:</p>
			<pre w:space="indent">
				Message!
			</pre>
			<p>The server resumes its response message. Note this can still include 1xx intermediate responses.</p>
			<pre type="message/http" w:space="indent">
				HTTP/1.1 200 OK
				Content-Type: text/plain

				Success!
			</pre>

			<h3>Example with Expectation Failed</h3>
			<p>The client begins by writing just the headers of the request:</p>
			<pre type="message/http" w:space="indent">
				PUT / HTTP/1.1
				Host: localhost
				Content-Type: text/plain
				Content-Length: 10
				Expect: 100-continue
			</pre>
			<p>A server that does not support <code>100-continue</code> will inform the client by writing an error as the final response:</p>
			<pre type="message/http" w:space="indent">
				HTTP/1.1 417 Expectation Failed
			</pre>
			<p>The client can then retry the upload, making the entire upload and waiting for the server to validate it.</p>

			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>RFC7231 removed the "expectation-extension" rule previously defined by RFC2616:</p>
			<pre type="abnf" w:space="indent">
				Expect       =  "Expect" ":" 1#expectation

				expectation  =  "100-continue" / expectation-extension
				expectation-extension =  token [ "=" ( token / quoted-string ) *expect-params ]
				expect-params =  ";" token [ "=" ( token / quoted-string ) ]
			</pre>

			<h1>404 Not Found</h1>
			<p>The 404 (Not Found) HTTP status code indicates the server does not have a document matching the request URI.</p>
			<p>This is a 4xx client error because it is typically generated by clients who fill out URI templates (such as HTML forms) with names that do not exist. It might be a server error if the record is merely missing, and needs to be restored, as is the case with broken links.</p>

			<h2>Writing responses (servers)</h2>
			<p>This status code is used when the resource does not exist, and the request method requires the resource to exist. This typically includes safe methods like GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS; as well as methods like POST.</p>
			<p>The response should include a document describing that the requested page was not found. You may wish to provide a way to report broken links to the webmaster.</p>
			<p>This status can also be used when disclosing the existence of a resource could be a security or privacy problem. If used for this purpose, authorization should be tested immediately after the resource is dereferenced. Take care that the behavior is identical to a "real" 404 response, and consider timing attacks.</p>
			<p>Servers may wish to log this error along with the request <a href="../headers/Referer.xml">Referer header</a>, if it exists, which can be used to fix broken links.</p>
			<p>If the resource has merely been deleted (for example, a "deleted" flag on the database record is set), then see <a href="410.xml">410 Gone</a> instead.</p>
			<p>Servers may wish to give users the opportunity to create the resource, for example, on wikis. If the request is for a URI used on another page, the server should provide instructions on how to create the resource, using a <code>rel=create-form</code> link, and should advertise the ability for clients to create the resource directly using an <code><a href="../headers/Allow.xml">Allow</a>: PUT</code> header.</p>
			<p>The exact contents of this error may vary by the URI, and the namespace that the URI falls under; for technical support, and to make the theme consistent with adjacent pages that do exist. For example, a request to <code>http://example.com/product/foobar</code> may mention that the server tried to look up a product, but did not find anything with that product ID "foobar".</p>

			<h2>Reading responses (clients)</h2>
			<p>A <code>404 Not Found</code> or <code><a href="410.xml">410 Gone</a></code> response indicates that the resource was not found on the server. In contrast, a 2xx response implies the resource does exist; any other status code is indeterminate.</p>
			<p>If the client found this resource from a link on another page, it may be an invitation for the client to create the resource. Otherwise, the user may want to inform the server operator of a broken link.</p>
			<p>If the client generated the URI from a URI template (such as an HTML form), it means the server has not created a resource with the specified parameters yet; the client may try creating the given resource using a <a href="../methods/PUT.xml">PUT request</a>.</p>
			<p>Some servers are known to hide the existence of resources until a user is sufficiently authorized to view the resource. If the server is known to require credentials, verify that the credentials work before trying other error recovery options.</p>
